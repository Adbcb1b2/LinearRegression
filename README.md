# Linear Regression in C

This project implements a simple **Linear Regression** program in C. It reads data points from a file, calculates the linear regression equation (y = mx + c), and allows the user to calculate `y` for a given `x`.

## Features

- Reads data points (x, y) from a CSV file.
- Calculates the linear regression equation using the least squares method.
- Allows the user to input a value for `x` to compute the corresponding `y` value.
- Implements memory management for dynamically allocated arrays.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you need:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A CSV file containing integer pairs separated by commas (e.g., `x,y`)

### File Format

The input file should contain data in the following format:
1,2
2,3
3,4
4,5
